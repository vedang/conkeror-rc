A repository for my Conkeror settings.
======================================

Conkeror loads it's settings from a file called .conkerorrc which should be present in your home directory.

My .conkerorrc has the following in it:

user_pref('conkeror.rcfile', '/home/vedang/conkeror-rc');
reinit();

This loads all the .js files in the conkeror-rc folder.
